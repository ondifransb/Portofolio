The design was a contemporary take on the traditional Balinese culture, a local boutique hotel made by local artisans. Overall, there are 1,5 million pieces of handmade Tabanan bricks that builds up the whole building. The design of Katamama was a response to The Potato Head Beach Club, which was built first. It was an attempt to counterbalance the curvy, elastic shape and colorful texture of the beach club, with a more rigid shape and monolithic texture with this new addition to the complex. This is done in order to create a contrast nuance, to enrich the spatial experience within the complex.",

The airport aims to embody a highly efficient passive design, which is particularly based on a traditional principle with contemporary and large-scale solution. In response to the local climate, the airport is articulated through optimization of building’s opening, overhang, and landscaping, providing passive temperature control through natural ventilation and sun shading. The airport is contested to reflect a context conscious airport building that has been generally side lined by standardization of international style airport. The roofing is shaped as combinations of hipped green roof that allows opening for skylight. As of now, the airport is still being developed for further expansions.",

The architecture of the mosque combines two elements that are usually found in mosque architecture, a dome and a minaret (tower), into one, by creating a large and tall tower as its main mass. Lampung’s traditional scripture were carved into several sides of the walls. The mosque implements Islamic numerology throughout its design. For example, the tower goes up to 30 meters, just as the number of 30 juz in the holy Qur’an, and there are 99 light openings at the top of the tower, taken out of the 99 names of Allah. As a house of worship, the mosque expresses vertically in its massing, to mirror human’s relationship with the higher power – as known as habluminallah.",

The residence closed up its own from the main road and opens itself up through the row of glass, towards the descending parts of the hills and the view of the city, in the southern part of the site. Bandung’s cool climate is balanced with the use of shingle wood on the roof, teak wood in the interior and ironwood in the balcony area. Aside from thermal considerations, atmosphere selection was also chosen to provide the comfort and sense of warmth in the villa, where the family would gather and rest.",

The residence was built as if it was a stage house, with columns standing and supporting the blocks of the house. The columns were made out of concrete, naturally exposed and round in its shape, in order to follow through the nature of the palm trees. With the intention to preserve the condition of the site as it is, the trees punctured through some of the interior spaces of the house. This gives more of a natural feel within the interior, bringing the outdoors inside.",
